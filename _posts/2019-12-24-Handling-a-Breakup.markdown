This is going to be a pretty tough time for you. You are hurt after a relationship which either you ended,
or, were forced out of because of it's toxicity. No amount of pain is ever going to measure up to it,
and you'd not want to listen to anyone. Fuck them. You don't have to listen to anyone's sermons now.
Only you know what you've been through. So, suck up the fact that you got screwed and that the relationship
is no more. The relationship is a separate organism that thrives on the things we do for love for each other
when either one isn't reciprocating, it just can't exist. Don't try to remain in the fantastic fantasy realm
where your relationship is rock solid. You're just killing yourself doing that.
<br>
Contrary to belief, getting out of a relationship doesn't actually take much time. At best, 3 days.
It is the part leading to you accepting that the relationship is no more, that takes all the time.
So, if you are still hung up on someone, or feel sad, or depressed or even get Anxiety Attacks, that just
tells you how much you loved the person, and how much you wanted to keep the Relationship alive.
<br>You did good <br>
You have to let go of the Relationship, cause, no matter how hard you try to hold onto it, It has already gone.
<br>
Good luck Screw Up!
