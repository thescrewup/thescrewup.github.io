Yes, in all probability, you did let yourself down.
It’s perfectly fine to fail. But, never stay a failure.
It’s a bad experience, and you don’t want to fail again.<br><br>
But, is it fine that you let yourself down? Yes!<br>
Should you feel sad? Yes!<br>
Should you try again with a different approach and renewed vigour? Fuck Yes!<br> <br>
<i> Failure is the Stepping Stone to Success...? </i>
<b> Fuck those quotes. </b>
There is no point in glorifying failure and saying it’s good to fail, cause that’s the only way we’d learn. Fuck no.
If you find anyone glorifying failure, or saying they relatively succeed, comparing them to worse cases of failures, it is cause they’re unable to accept the fact that they were unprepared, and they flunked big time.
Their Ego is just far greater than their reality itself.
You failed in something, probably got kicked out, from your home, or your job, your relationship or even all these.
But, Why? Why should that happen just to you?
Everyone goes through it. But, everyone's timeline is different. Life spares none. Even the ones we think are fortunate, have their own demons they have to overcome. Nothing is going to happen just cause you continue to whine.
There is no pride in saying you are a successful failure. It’s  pathetic. No one remembers your failure, unless you killed a few men cause you failed in your job. I call this the Titanic Theory.
We’d not know anything about the Titanic if a movie wasn’t made, and it becoming so popular.
Get it? Failures aren't celebrated unless it kills. <br><br>
Now, don't start killing!
<br>
You fucking won a swimming race even before you had developed any organs, and had the ability to think.
You won the race of life, and were a success 10 months before you were born!
You see where the doubt comes from? <b> The Brain.</b>
It is wonderful, it makes you do amazing things, but, sometimes, loses itself in its own complications. It is that these times, that you need to convince your brain’s stupid ass areas that, you are already a success, and can take on anything, and rather than seeing the failure, to look for ways to succeed.
